  <div class="explainationIrishElk">
		<p>The <i>Irisk Elk (aka Megaloceros giganteus)</i> is a giant extinct deer, the largest deer species ever, that stood up to seven feet at the shoulder (2.1 meters), with antlers spanning up to 12 feet (3.65 meters).</p>
		<p> The <i>Irisk Elk</i> evolved during the glacial periods of the last million years, during the Pleistocene Epoch.</p>
		<p>It ranged throughout Europe, northern Asia and northern Africa, and a related form is known from <i>China</i>.</p>
		<p> The name <i>"Irish"</i> has stuck because excellent, well-preserved fossils of the giant deer are especially common in lake sediments and peat bogs in Ireland.</p>
		<p>The skull on display at the <i>old UC Museum of Paleontology came from such a locality, 18 miles north of Dublin.</i> Such skulls, with their enormous racks of antlers, adorn the walls of castles and hunting lodges throughout Ireland.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, the complete skeleton pictured at the top of the page, on display at the Paleontological Institute in Moscow, was found at the other end of Europe, near the Russian town of Sapozhka.</p>
