# Nothing really
Yeah this project is basically made out of glue and a bunch of other shit, If I did this without the "glue and a bunch of other shit", probably would've took like 3 days on average. Learning HTML, CSS, pretty sure i know it's not hard. just needed to get this done lmao i might try to fix all this up, i made some of the assets, some from a website

so yeah source code of this nothing really html project for school
